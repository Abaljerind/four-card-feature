## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this challenge is the first time i use display grid using TailwindCSS and it is actually feel easy, but still i had to make a little adjustment so that the code works perfectly. Here it is the codes;

```html
<h1>Some HTML & CSS inline code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```html
<div class="cards sm:mt-12 sm:grid sm:grid-cols-2 sm:gap-5 lg:ml-14 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-7 2xl:ml-20">
  <div class="mt-16 rounded-lg border-t-[0.5rem] border-t-cyan bg-white shadow-xl sm:mt-8 sm:place-self-start lg:ml-10 lg:mt-5 lg:w-[375px] lg:place-self-center 2xl:ml-20"></div>
</div>
```

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this tailwind css and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
